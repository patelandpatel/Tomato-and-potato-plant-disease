                <p>
                    This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict student math scores based on various factors. It demonstrates how educational outcomes can be influenced by different variables and helps identify areas where support might be needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The model was trained on a dataset containing information about students' demographics, family background, and educational experiences. It achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting math scores based on these factors.
                </p>
